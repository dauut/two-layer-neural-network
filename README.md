# three-layer-neural-network

 In  this  project,  the  multilayer  artificial  neuralnetwork  algorithm  implemented  with  python  language. The project
  supports 2 output and 3 output networks.
 
 #### Calculate Loss
 Cross-entropy loss applied. 
 #### Predict
 *tanh* and *softmax* activation functions used. 
 #### Build Model
 This function takes 2D input array and calculates 2D prediction vector. While building a model forward-
 propagation performed for making a prediction, and backpropagation applied to update the network parameters.
 #### Build Model 691 
 This function takes 2 input and classify 3 output labels.
